Conductor Console Solution Calculator
=====================================


Summary
-------

A simple Python script which prints the possible final configurations of Spire's conductor console puzzle from Myst IV: Revelation.

Some settings exist to customise properties of the puzzle, but are currently set to match the large console on the far island.
